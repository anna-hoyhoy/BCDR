# Capstone BCDR Project - Terraform Configuration

## Introduction

The **Capstone BCDR Project** is designed to create a reliable, scalable, and automated infrastructure for **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR)** using **Terraform**. The project focuses on provisioning essential resources in **Microsoft Azure**, including **Recovery Services Vaults**, **Resource Groups**, **Virtual Networks**, and **Virtual Machines**, all of which are critical components for disaster recovery planning. The goal is to ensure **high availability** and **system resilience** during unexpected system failures or disasters by utilizing Azure's cloud infrastructure.

This project was developed in tandem with an internship, where it was applied to real-world scenarios, automating disaster recovery processes and reducing downtime in cloud environments.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these instructions.

### 1. Installation Process

Before running this project, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

#### Visual Studio Code

Download and install **Visual Studio Code** from the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

#### Terraform

You need **Terraform** to manage the cloud infrastructure. Follow these steps to install it:

- Go to the [Terraform download page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) to select the appropriate version for your OS.

For specific installation instructions:

- **macOS** (Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install terraform
    ```
- **Windows** (via Chocolatey):
    ```bash
    choco install terraform
    ```
- **Linux** (via apt):
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install terraform
    ```

#### Azure CLI

To interact with Microsoft Azure, you must install the **Azure CLI**. Follow the installation steps from the [Azure CLI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

After installation, verify it by running:
```bash
az --version
```

### 2. Configuration

Before running Terraform, you'll need to configure your Azure environment and authenticate with Azure CLI. To authenticate:

```bash
az login
```

This will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Azure account.

### 3. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command in the root directory of this repository to initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

This will download the necessary provider plugins and prepare the workspace.

## Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the repository structure:

```
.
├── main.tf              # Main Terraform configuration file
├── variables.tf         # Variables for Terraform configuration
├── outputs.tf           # Outputs from the Terraform execution
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── .gitignore           # Git ignore file to exclude sensitive files
```

- **main.tf**: This file contains the main configuration for deploying the Azure resources (Recovery Vault, Virtual Machines, etc.).
- **variables.tf**: Defines the variables used in the main configuration to make the project modular and flexible.
- **outputs.tf**: Specifies the output values from Terraform execution, such as the public IP of the deployed virtual machines.

## Usage

To deploy the resources in Azure:

1. Run the following command to create an execution plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

2. Apply the changes to create the resources in Azure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

This will provision the necessary resources such as **Resource Groups**, **Recovery Vaults**, and **Virtual Machines** in your Azure environment.
